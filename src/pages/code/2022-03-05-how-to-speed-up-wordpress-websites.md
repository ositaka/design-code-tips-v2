This video shows you a good starting point to achieve a faster page load. You might have to spend an additional amount of hours debugging, testing, changing, and re-testing all your settings and delivery strategy.

With this said, as long as your website has a proper Hosting service, the right Caching strategy, Image Optimization (modern image type files, with lazy load) and a CDN, your website will load pretty faster, comparing it with no optimization at all. After that, you might need to carefully combine your CSS files, and defer non-essential JavaScript files, to prevent render blocking.

Please note: the best way of having an extremely fast website is when you make your "own template" and don't use "commercial themes", as they are often loaded with extra CSS/JS files â€” this happens, because these themes are meant to have broadly functionalities, and not to serve a unique purpose or business.
