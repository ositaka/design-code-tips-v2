## How to download on Windows

Yes, you can. You can [use HTTrack to download an entire website](/tools/2019-03-12-httrack/ 'See more info about HTTrack on Tools') on Windows.

I have used it in the past to donwload entire WordPress websites, and host them on Netlify as static websites. You can use this approach for those WordPress websites that has never changed over time and will not change in the future.
