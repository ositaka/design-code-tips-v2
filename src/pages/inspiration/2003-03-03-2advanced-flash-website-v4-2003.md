Currently, the 2Advanced Studios are closed for real, since some years already.

> Eric Jordan, Tony Novak, and John Carrol founded a digital creative agency called 2Advanced Studios. The agency was renowned for its innovative, high-end design using Flash technology. In the field of web design, the 2Advanced Studio received many prestigious awards.

In any case, if you are really curious about the mastermind behind the 2Advanced studios, you can [check Eric Jordan's official website](https://www.ericjordan.com/), the former founder of 2Advanced Studios. He still makes top-notch visual effects and lovely "high-tech" animations. Besides that, he's also a music producer, being the sound designer behind all the 2Advanced Studios projects. You can [check Eric Jordan's SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/ericjordan) and enjoy some melodic dance music.

I've found [Shane Mielke's official website](https://www.shanemielke.com/), who was 10 years the Creative Director at 2Advanced Studios, and still makes stunning websites nowadays, for clients like Adobe, NFL and SpaceX.
