[![LanguageTool (site overview)](/media/language-tool.png)](https://languagetool.org/ "Go to LanguageTool's website")

This tool is my spell checker of choice. With a great design and simplicity of usage, you will "enhance" all your texts from now on.

I have been using this tool mostly for texts written in English.

## Fun fact about LanguageTool: 4 sub-languages of Portuguese

I am surprised with this tool, because I've realized it even has 4 sub-languages of Portuguese: Angola, Brazil, Mozambique and Portugal.

Me, as a Portuguese, I always find these kinds of spell checkers or translating tools a joke, because often they always translate to "Portuguese" (from Brazil), because of the much bigger number of users using those tools in Brazil.
