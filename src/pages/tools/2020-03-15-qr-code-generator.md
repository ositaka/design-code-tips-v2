## What is a QR Code?

> A QR Code is a two-dimensional barcode that is readable by smartphones. It allows to encode over 4000 characters in a two dimensional barcode. QR Codes may be used to display text to the user, to open a URL, save a contact to the address book or to compose text messages. "QR Code" is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.

> To read QR Codes with a smartphone, you can just use the default camera app.

## What are Static QR Codes?

> Static QR Codes encode the content directly in the image itself. You can think of them like regular printed text, just represented in different way. That means you cannot update the content once generated. Because the content is directly encoded in the image, they also grow in size with the amount of content they store.

## What are Dynamic QR Codes?

> The content of a Static QR Code cannot be changed once generated. What is referred to as a Dynamic QR Code, is a QR Code pointing to a static URL that hosts the actual content (e.g. the real URL). The hosted content can be changed after the QR Code has been printed.
